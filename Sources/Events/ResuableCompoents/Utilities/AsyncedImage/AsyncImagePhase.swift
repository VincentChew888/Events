import SwiftUI

/// The current phase of the asynchronous image loading operation.
///
/// When you create an ``AsyncImage`` instance with the
/// ``AsyncImage/init(url:scale:transaction:content:)`` initializer, you define
/// the appearance of the view using a `content` closure. SwiftUI calls the
/// closure with a phase value at different points during the load operation
/// to indicate the current state. Use the phase to decide what to draw.
/// For example, you can draw the loaded image if it exists, a view that
/// indicates an error, or a placeholder:
///
///     AsyncImage(url: URL(string: "https://example.com/icon.png")) { phase in
///         if let image = phase.image {
///             image // Displays the loaded image.
///         } else if phase.error != nil {
///             Color.red // Indicates an error.
///         } else {
///             Color.blue // Acts as a placeholder.
///         }
///     }
